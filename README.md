## MavenRail Dataset
This dataset consists of 31645 records of mock rail journeys by passengers via National Rail in the England, Scotland and Wales during the period 01.Jan.2024 – 30.Apr.2024.
The data includes mock train ticket sales that contain details about passenger details, payment methods, ticket types, journey times, destinations, delays and refund requests.

Origin of data comes from Maven Analytics Challenge where it asked participants of the competition to create an exploratory dashboard to:

• Identify the most popular routes

• Determine peak travel times

• Analyze revenue from different ticket types & classes

• Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors

Performed EDA on the data, found hidden insights and correlations between data, later on I developed a Logistic Regression model that can predict likelihood of passenger to request a refund
